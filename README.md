# Firebase Studio Project

This is a Next.js starter project created in Firebase Studio. To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Frontend (Next.js)

This application is built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

### Running the Frontend

To run the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Next.js application, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

## Backend (Python - Optional)

This project is configured to work with a Node.js-based Genkit backend for AI features. However, if you wish to set up a separate Python backend for other business logic, here are some general instructions.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- `pip` for package management

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Create a Backend Directory:**
    It's good practice to keep your backend code in a separate directory.

    ```bash
    mkdir backend
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    A virtual environment keeps your project dependencies isolated.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    You'll likely want a web framework like Flask or FastAPI. Create a `requirements.txt` file.

    `requirements.txt`:
    ```
    Flask==3.0.0
    Flask-Cors==4.0.0
    # Add other dependencies like a database connector (e.g., psycopg2-binary, mysql-connector-python)
    ```

    Install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Create Your Application:**
    Create a simple application file, e.g., `app.py`.

    `app.py`:
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, jsonify
    from flask_cors import CORS

    app = Flask(__name__)
    CORS(app)  # Allow requests from your Next.js frontend

    @app.route('/api/hello')
    def hello_world():
        return jsonify(message='Hello from the Python backend!')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
    ```

5.  **Running the Backend:**
    Start your Python backend server.

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    Your backend will be running, typically on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Database Integration

For database integration, you would:
1.  Choose a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).
2.  Install the appropriate Python connector library via `pip`.
3.  Configure your connection string, often using environment variables for security.
4.  Write functions in your Python app to connect to the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

To connect your Next.js frontend to this backend, you would make API calls to the endpoints you define in your Python application (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/hello`).
